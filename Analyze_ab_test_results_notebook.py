# ### Introduction
# 
# A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 
# 
# For this project, We will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  We goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# For the rows where **treatment** does not match with **new_page** or **control** does not match with **old_page**, we cannot be sure if this row truly received the new or old page. We create a new dataset and we store your new dataframe in **df2**.

# In[9]:


df2=df.drop(df.query('(landing_page == "new_page" and group !="treatment") or (landing_page != "new_page" and group =="treatment") or (landing_page == "old_page" and group !="control")or (landing_page != "old_page" and group =="control")').index)

# #### Now we must ask if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new treatment page leads to more conversions?

# The overall conversion rate before clean up the data is 0.11965919355605512.
# the overall conversion rate after clean up the data is 0.11959708724499628.
# Conversion rates are very close, so further study is required.

# <a id='ab_test'></a>
# ### Part II - A/B Test
# 
# Notice that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed.  
# 
# However, then the hard question is do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time?  How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?  
# 
# Hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.

# 
# $$H_0: $P_{new}$-$P_{old}$ \geq 0 $$
# $$H_1: $P_{new}$-$P_{old}$ > 0 $$

# 
# Assume under the null hypothesis, $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ both have "true" success rates equal to the **converted** success rate regardless of page - that is $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal. Furthermore, assume they are equal to the **converted** rate in **ab_data.csv** regardless of the page. <br><br>
# 
# We use a sample size for each page equal to the ones in **ab_data.csv**.  <br><br>
# 
# We perform the sampling distribution for the difference in **converted** between the two pages over 10,000 iterations of calculating an estimate from the null.  <br><br>
# 

# In[20]:


df2.head()


# What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{new}$ under the null? 

# In[21]:


p_new=df2["converted"].mean()
p_new


# What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{old}$ under the null? <br><br>

# In[22]:


p_old=df2["converted"].mean()
p_old


# What is $n_{new}$, the number of individuals in the treatment group?

# In[23]:


n_new=df2.query('landing_page == "new_page"').shape[0]
n_new


# What is $n_{old}$, the number of individuals in the control group?

# In[24]:


n_old=df2.query('landing_page == "old_page"').shape[0]
n_old


# We simulate $n_{new}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{new}$ under the null.  We store these $n_{new}$ 1's and 0's in **new_page_converted**.

# In[25]:


new_page_converted= np.random.binomial(1, p_new , n_new)
n_m = new_page_converted.mean()
n_m


# We simulate $n_{old}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{old}$ under the null.  We store these $n_{old}$ 1's and 0's in **old_page_converted**.

# In[26]:


old_page_converted= np.random.binomial(1 , p_old, n_old)
o_m = old_page_converted.mean()
o_m


# Find $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ for simulated values 

# In[27]:


obs_diff= n_m - o_m
obs_diff


# We create 10,000 $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ values and We store all 10,000 values in a NumPy array called **p_diffs**.

# In[28]:


p_diffs= []
size = df2.shape[0]
for _ in range(10000):
    b_samp = df.sample(size, replace=True)
    new_page_converted= np.random.binomial(1, p_new , n_new)
    old_page_converted= np.random.binomial(1 , p_old, n_old)
    p_diffs.append((new_page_converted.mean()) - (old_page_converted.mean()))
    
    


# In[29]:


p_diffs= np.array(p_diffs)


# We plot a histogram of the **p_diffs**.  Does this plot look like what you expected? 

# In[30]:


plt.hist(p_diffs);
plt.axvline(x=obs_diff, color='red')


# What proportion of the **p_diffs** are greater than the actual difference observed in **ab_data.csv**?

# In[31]:


p_val= (p_diffs > obs_diff ).mean()
p_val


# 
# 
# In the **previous cell** we calculated p-value. Ti is the probability of getting our statistic or a more extreme value if the null is true.
# Becuse the p-value is largeØŒ we have evidence that our statistic was likely to come from the null hypothesis. Therefore, we do not have evidence to reject the null.

# We could also use a built-in to achieve similar results.  Though using the built-in might be easier to code, the above portions are a walkthrough of the ideas that are critical to correctly thinking about statistical significance. We fill in the below to calculate the number of conversions for each page, as well as the number of individuals who received each page.  `n_old` and `n_new` refer the the number of rows associated with the old page and new pages, respectively.

# In[32]:


df2.head()


# In[33]:


convert_old = df2.query('group == "control"')["converted"].sum()
convert_new = df2.query('group == "treatment"')["converted"].sum()
n_old = df2.query('landing_page == "old_page"').shape[0]
n_new = df2.query('landing_page == "new_page"').shape[0]
print(convert_old, convert_new, n_old, n_new)


# Now we use `stats.proportions_ztest` to compute your test statistic and p-value.  [Here](http://knowledgetack.com/python/statsmodels/proportions_ztest/) is a helpful link on using the built in.

# In[34]:


z_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_old, convert_new], [n_old, n_new], alternative='smaller')
z_score, p_value


# **Z-score** measures the number of standard deviations from the mean a data point and that helps us decide whether or not to reject the null . A z_score equals 1.310924 which is small. But the p-value equals 0.90505 which is quite large. Based on the p-value we accept the null hypothesis. That mean the converstions from the old page are
# statistically better than the new.

# ### Part III - A regression approach
# 
# `1.` In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.<br><br> 
# 
# a. Since each row is either a conversion or no conversion, what type of regression should you be performing in this case?

# **Now we will perform the regression logistic regression model.  We will use statsmodels Logit method.**

# First, we need to create in df2 a column for the intercept, and create a dummy variable column for which page each user received.  We add an **intercept** column, as well as an **ab_page** column, which is 1 when an individual receives the **treatment** and 0 if **control**.

# In[35]:


df2.head()


# In[36]:


df2['intercept'] = 1
df2['ab_page'] = pd.get_dummies(df['group'])['treatment']
df2.head()


# In[37]:


#drop some columns 
df2 = df2.drop(['timestamp', 'group'], axis=1)
df2.head()


# We use statsmodels to instantiate regression model on the two columns we created , then we fit the model using the two columns we created. to predict whether or not an individual converts.

# In[38]:


log_mod = sm.Logit(df2['converted'], df2[['intercept', 'ab_page']])
results = log_mod.fit()
results.summary()


# In logistic interpretation ,we need to exponentiate the coefficients. Each of these exponentiated values is the multiplicative change in the odds of conversion occurring. 
# 
# 

# In[39]:


np.exp(-1.9888), np.exp(-0.0150)


# In[40]:


#because the values negative we use as 1/np.exp() to explain easy.
1/np.exp(-1.9888), 1/np.exp(-0.0150)


# We use the summary of model  to answer the following questions.

# What is the p-value associated with **ab_page**? Why does it differ from the value you found in **Part II**?<br><br> 

# The p_value is 0.190. These p-values differ from Part II because in the A/B test our null hypothesis states that the old page is better than, or equal to, the new page. The hypotheses in Part II is a one tail test. Part III is a two tail regression test.
# 
# 
# 

# 
# 
# Why it is a good idea to consider other factors to add into regression model. Are there any disadvantages to adding additional terms into regression model?

# I think there many factors that effect on the converts . For example, the user is a child, a young person or a sane?. In other words, the age group affects  on converts.

# Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. We will need to read in the **countries.csv** dataset and merge together  datasets on the appropriate rows.  [Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) are the docs for joining tables. 
# 
# Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  

# In[41]:


df3=pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
df3.head()


# In[42]:


df3 = df3.set_index('user_id').join(df2.set_index('user_id'), how='inner')
df3.head()


# In[43]:


#the number of missing values?
df3.isnull().sum()


# In[44]:


df3['country'].unique()


# In[45]:


# create dummy variables for these country columns
df3[['UK', 'US', 'CA']] = pd.get_dummies(df3['country'])
df3 = df3.drop(['country', 'CA'], axis=1)
df3.head()


# In[46]:


log_mod3 = sm.Logit(df3['converted'], df3[['intercept', 'ab_page', 'UK', 'US']])
results3 = log_mod3.fit()
results3.summary()


# In[47]:


1/np.exp(-1.9893), 1/np.exp(-0.0149), 1/np.exp(-0.0408), 1/np.exp(0.0099)


# Through this model we conclude that:
# 
# **UK** is 1.04 times less likely to convert compared to CA overall conversions.
# 
# **US** is 0.99 times more likely to convert compared to CA overall conversions.

# We would now like to look at an interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion. We create the necessary additional columns, and fit the new model. 
# 
# Provide the summary results, and your conclusions based on the results.

# In[48]:


df3['UK_new_page'] = df3['UK']*df3['ab_page']
df3['US_new_page'] = df3['US']*df3['ab_page']
df3.head()


# In[49]:


log_mod3 = sm.Logit(df3['converted'], df3[['intercept', 'UK_new_page', 'US_new_page']])
results3 = log_mod3.fit()
results3.summary()


# In[50]:


1/np.exp(-0.0752), 1/np.exp(0.0149)


# Through this model we conclude that:
# 
# **UK** is 1.078 times less likely to convert compared to CA overall conversions that received the new page.
# 
# **US** is 0.985 times more likely to convert compared to CA overall conversions that received the new page.
# 
# That mean the UK conversions overall and for the new page is lower, and in the US overall and new page conversions is higher compared to the CA.
